== Thingverse Components

Thingverse depends on multiple technologies to support high availability, scalability and resiliency features.
The platform exposes multiple components with each having a specific purpose.
We discuss these components in the following sections but let's first have a look at Thingverse architecture.

The core components are described in the following sections.

[[thingverse-api]]
=== Thingverse API

The Thingverse API application exposes REST over HTTP(S) endpoints for interacting with the backend (Akka cluster).
MQTT support is coming in the 2.X release train.
The APIs are secured using JWT tokens and the caller is expected to authenticate an acquire a short lived token.
Support for other authentication mechanisms are coming in future releases.

The API application ships with HA support and can be deployed across Data centers or public cloud zones (multi-cloud included).
The API application instances are discovered using Consul Service Discovery, and are eventually load balanced by Zuul Proxy.

[[thingverse-backend]]
=== Thingverse Backend

The Thingverse backend exposes one or more(in clustered mode, see <<operation-modes, Modes of Operation>>) Akka Actor systems that host Akka Actors.
An Akka Actor is a light weight process that models a single physical thing.
Each actor has a mailbox of its own which can receive messages.
Akka actors can receive and send messages to any other actors.

[[thingverse-consul]]
=== Consul

Consul is an excellent Discovery Service that is multi-dc and multi cloud-zone aware. It supports discovery over both
LAN and WAN.

However, Consul is a rather complex system which requires very careful consideration for running successfully in a
production configuration. You can however run it in `dev` mode which is easy and sufficient for testing purposes.

[[thingverse-consul-dev]]
==== Running Consul in Dev Mode
Once Consul is running you can start it using the following commands.

[[thingverse-consul-dev-macOS]]
===== Windows
TODO

===== macOS
If you have installed Consul using `Homebrew`, you can start Consul using:
----
brew services start consul
----

===== Linux
TODO

[[thingverse-consul-ui]]
==== Consul UI
Once Consul is running, you can access the UI at http://localhost:8500/ui/dc1/services. You should see a UI as shown below.
