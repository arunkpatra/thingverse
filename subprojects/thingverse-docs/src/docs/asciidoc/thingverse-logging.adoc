== Production Logging

A production deployment requires careful evaluation of all aspects related to the availability goals of your services and the SLAs related to return to service following a failure.
Access to system and application logs can help you quickly determine the root cause of a failure and in many cases can alert you (and take action) before a catastrophic failure occurs.

Setting up log capture, shipping, real-time analysis and alerting is a non-trivial task and *Thingverse Enterprise Support* can help you with this.
