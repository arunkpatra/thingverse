== Production Deployment

For Thingverse production deployments, each component of the Thingverse platform must support high availability features like automated horizontal scaling, load balancing, multi-dc and multi-zone support and failover.
The best way to start with, is probably to leverage public cloud services for platform services like Cassandra.
For other services native to Thingverse you need to manage all the above features yourself.
*Thingverse Enterprise Support* can help you with this.
