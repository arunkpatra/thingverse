== Production Monitoring

A production deployment requires careful evaluation of all aspects related to the availability goals of your services and the SLAs related to return to service following a failure.
Efficient monitoring is a necessity for production deployments and can help you quickly determine the root cause of a failure and in many cases can alert you (and take action) before a catastrophic failure occurs.

Setting up production monitoring and alerting is a non-trivial task and *Thingverse Enterprise Support* can help you with this.

You need to provision Prometheus first. Once you are ready, launch Prometheus using the following command.
----
./prometheus --config.file=prometheus.yml
----
The `prometheus.yml` file must have the following configs. This sets up service discovery for Prometheus to discover
Thingverse API nodes and pull metrics from the backend cluster. You can replace `localhost:8500` with the actual
endpoint of your Consul server. If Consul server itself is running in distributed mode, Prometheus would be able to
scrape from all nodes of the cluster across multiple data centers and zones.

----
scrape_configs:
  # Thingverse scrape
  - job_name: 'thingverse'
    metrics_path: '/actuator/prometheus'
    scrape_interval: 5s
    consul_sd_configs:
    - server: 'localhost:8500'
      services: ['thingverse-api']
----
[NOTE]
====
If you are using Consul for discovering your API endpoints, you must start Consul first.
See <<thingverse-consul, Starting Consul>> for more details.
====
Once Prometheus is running, you can access the Prometheus UI to verify arrival of your metrics. The UI is available
at http://localhost:9090/graph.

[[monitoring-dashboards]]
=== Metrics Dashboards
Once your monitoring data has been aggregated in time series format by Prometheus, you are ready to visualize the data
using Grafana. Once Grafana is installed, you can start it as follows.

[[monitoring-dashboard-graphana]]
==== macOS

----
brew services start grafana
----

Grafana dashboard will be available at http://localhost:3000/. You should see a UI as shown below.
