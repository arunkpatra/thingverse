The Thingverse platform allows virtualizing physical things. It allows you 
to interact with real things via their virtual counterparts and build higher
level functions as per your business needs. Thingverse is business domain agnostic. 
It works at extreme levels of concurrency, is self-healing, resilient and scales to
billions of things while using the minimum possible compute and memory resources. Whether on-prem or the largest
Kubernetes Cluster in the cloud, its the same for Thingverse.
